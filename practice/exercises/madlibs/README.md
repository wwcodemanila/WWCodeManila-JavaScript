# Mad Libs

Mad Libs is a "template" game where you ask the user for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story or phrase.

1. Choose your mad lib. You can search online or come up with your own story/phrase.
Examples:
- "What came first the chicken or the ______?"
- "Once upon a time, ______ went to the _______ to _________."

2. Declare a new variable and ask the user for the value of each blank/missing part in your chosen madlib.

3. Form a new string substituting the blanks with the values given by the user. (hint: use string concatenation)

3. Display the result either through logging it to the console or using alert.

To get a user's input, you may choose to use `prompt()` as shown below then save it to a variable.

`let name = prompt("Enter a name.")`

Bonus: If you're already familiar with JavaScript DOM manipulation, you can choose to display the text on the HTML page.
