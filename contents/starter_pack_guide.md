# How to Read This Guide

If you are a complete beginner to JavaScript or web development, read both **Web Fundamentals** sections first.

You can read the **Introduction to JavaScript** sections in any order.  Some people prefer to learn [language fundamentals](contents/js_language_features.md) first, while others learn better by diving into [examples](contents/js_web_applications.md).  Pick the one that interests you more and refer to the other as needed.
