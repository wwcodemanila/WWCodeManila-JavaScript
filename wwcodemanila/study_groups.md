Study groups are events where members can come together and help each other learn and understand a specific programming language, technology, or anything related to coding, engineering, design.

Everyone is welcome to the event as long as they want to learn and share their knowledge with the community and they are following the [code of conduct](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/guidelines-resources/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
